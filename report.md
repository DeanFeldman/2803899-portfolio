In this lab I learned how to use Git and GitHub for version control.

I practiced creating repositories, branches, and meaningful commit messages.

I also learned how to structure & create a webpage using semantic HTML5 elements.

I learnt the commands to find git status, add files, push files and commit changes.

Deploying the site with GitHub Pages helped me understand static hosting.
