            <h3> Latest Project </h3>
            <p>
                I am currently working on a game project called Kalooki, also known as Jamaican rummy that includes 4 players and 2 decks of cards.
                I am creating a web version to get a MVP - Minimum Viable Product and then hope to be able top expand and create a real multiplayer app on the play store.
